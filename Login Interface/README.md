# Login-Interface
A repository for my C++ login interface project.

This is a terminal application that functions as a command prompt and an interface for a service that allows its users to sign up, log in and sign out of specific accounts with designated information such as usernames, emails and passwords. The database consists of a map of key:value pairs of strings and objects of a custom class, "User". Every user has a unique username, which also serves as the name of the key, a password which can be changed, a unique email and a boolean admin status (false by default).

Commands are listed in "Commands.md"
